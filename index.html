I remember when we were still in training I was nervous to take calls as I had been handling chat support for almost 2 years. However, when I took my first call I didn’t expect it to have a higher score of 95% QA score out of 100%. With that in mind, I learned that if you are doing the right things and you are equipped there’s no reason for you to be scared of and just do it correctly. Overall, I was happy that my stay in Telus left me with fruitful knowledge and wisdom, and will surely take this experience to my journey. </p> </li>
